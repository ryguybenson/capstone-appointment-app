## Description

_This application is an app to easily setup and schedule appointments for True North Photography. It will allow users to mark a calendar to schedule appointments, pay for photo-shoot sessions, and look up additional information about the company._

## First Friday Work-Flow
_From about 8-10 a.m. I went over what exactly this application needed in detail and what I thought I should prioritize as MVP. I also spent a part of that time looking at other appointment apps online to get inspiration. As a result of this my MVP has changed quite a bit. The messaging feature is no longer a part of the MVP and it will be built using mobile first design. I am tempted to use React native but honestly am unsure if I would be able to complete a solid piece if presentable work by presentation day. So I will just use regular React and can always go back later if I choose to. After that my day consisted of looking at other appointment apps and choosing the parts from specific websites I would like to mirror in my design as well as completing wireframes using Lunacy. I was able to find the color scheme I would like to use as well as design multiple pages and create general layouts for others._
